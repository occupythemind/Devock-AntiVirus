<p>Welcome to the Devock documentation! Here you’ll find all the information you need to get started with Devock and make the most of its features.</p>

<p>
    Malware attacks on devices are increasing daily, especially on systems owned by large organizations — ransomware being a prime example. 
    After studying the nature of these attacks, I found that 60–70% are caused by the device owners or handlers themselves, 
    often by downloading files without proper verification. While I don’t place all the blame on them (since not everyone understands how these things work), 
    this is where <strong>Devock</strong> comes in.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Devock Antivirus</strong> is a tool designed to prevent malicious software from infecting a device. Although this version is tailored for Linux, 
    we’re currently working on Windows and macOS versions, which will be released soon.
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>What Devock Does</h3>
<p>
    Devock operates at the network level using a Python module called <strong>mitmproxy</strong>, which allows it to intercept and analyze traffic entering and leaving a device.
    It listens for responses from servers and detects whether the response contains a downloadable application or file.
</p>

<p>
    When such a file is detected, Devock intercepts the traffic, copies the file bytes, and saves them in a quarantine directory at <code>/mnt/quarantine1</code>.
    It then scans the file using <strong>ClamAV</strong> (via the <code>clamscan</code> utility), which checks for known malware signatures.
</p>

<p>
    If malware is found, the scan returns <strong>FOUND</strong>; otherwise, it returns <strong>OK</strong>. 
    Safe files are moved to the user’s Downloads folder, while malicious ones are deleted upon unmount.
</p>

<p>
    The directory <code>/mnt/quarantine1</code> serves as a mount point for a <strong>tmpfs</strong> — a temporary storage filesystem.
    When unmounted, all data within it, including any quarantined files, is erased — a useful security feature.
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>How to Get Started</h3>
<p>
    After downloading Devock, you'll find a script named <code>install.sh</code>. Run it using:
</p>
<div class="card mb-3" style="background-color: lightgrey;">
    <div class="card-body">
        <b>
            ~$ sh install.sh <span style="color: blue">or make it executable:</span><br>
            ~$ chmod +x install.sh<br>
            ~$ ./install.sh
        </b>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Next, configure your browser’s proxy settings to <strong>127.0.0.1:8080</strong> — the default for mitmproxy.
    Start mitmproxy using:
</p>
<div class="card mb-3" style="background-color: lightgrey;">
    <div class="card-body">
        <b>
            ~$ mitmproxy <span style="color: blue">or</span><br>
            ~$ mitmweb
        </b>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Visit <a href="http://mitm.it">mitm.it</a> to download the necessary SSL certificate for Linux.
    The certificate will typically have a <strong>.pem</strong> extension. Follow the provided instructions carefully.
    For Firefox users, additional steps might be needed to install and trust the certificate. Once installed, mitmproxy can decrypt HTTPS traffic for inspection.
</p>

<p>
    After running <code>install.sh</code>, a systemd service should be created, allowing Devock to run in the background and on system reboot.
    If any issues arise, you can run Devock manually using the <code>autorun.sh</code> script located in the same directory:
</p>
<div class="card mb-3" style="background-color: lightgrey;">
    <div class="card-body">
        <b>
            ~$ sh autorun.sh <span style="color: blue">or</span><br>
            ~$ ./autorun.sh <span style="color: blue">(if executable)</span>
        </b>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    From this point onward, as you browse and download files, Devock will continuously inspect the files before allowing them onto your system.
</p>

<br><br>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>
    We're planning to extend Devock's capabilities to include storage-level monitoring in the next release.
